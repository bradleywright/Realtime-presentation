Who am I?
=========

- Australian, where I worked for an agency making websites for many reputable brands
- Head of Web Development at betting exchange Smarkets, a London-based startup
- Web developer for 10 years, including two years at Yahoo! as a senior developer
- My background in this specific topic is that we've been doing various forms of real-time odds and sports data for a few years now. This talk is based on all the things I've learned, and also because there doesn't seem to be any definitive resource with this information

Overview
========

- These are the key points and areas I'll be going over during my talk, just so you're aware of the level I'm aiming at.
- I'm assuming most people have some experience with Ajax, since I'll be skipping that bit to focus on techniques that can mimic or provide server-pushed events to the browser

A short demo

What does "real time web programming" mean?
===========================================

Real world web examples

Who really needs it?
====================

How does it work?
=================

- This part of the talk is broken down into 3 sections:
- The old way:

  - Some of these techniques are as old as Ajax itself, so circa
  - We detail the various hacks and ways that people have previously done push updates (why I use scare quotes around push will become clear)
  - We examine the pitfalls and benefits of each way
  - All this is really to impress on you that these techniques are hacky and experimental, so caution should be used when building The Futureâ„¢

- The current (or upcoming, given it's all about as current as HTML 5 or CSS 3) standard:

  - Spoiler: it's WebSockets
  - There's another standard similar to long polling: Server Sent Events

- The elephant in the room:

  - There's a well-known security issue with the interaction between WebSockets and transparent proxies, which we'll talk about

Polling
=======

- Works with regular Ajax and ``window.setTimeout``
- Doesn't require a special server
- Problems:

  - Excessive network latency from many HTTP requests
  - Makes the server and client do work for potentially no reason - Data might not have changed between polls

- If you must do long polling (legacy server architecture, shared hosting), Best practice is to use ``If-Modified-Since`` on the client and return 304 responses to cut down on browser/network payload

Long-polling
============

- Basically server holds connection open until it has something to send
- Reduces latency and "has anything changed?" issues introduced by polling
- However, it requires a custom server and application stack

  - Apache (or another standard prefork server) will just run out of workers

    - Imagine you spawn 60 prefork workers
    - After 60 Ajax long-polling connections your server can no longer serve requests, as they're all being held

  - Still not entirely efficient: when you return a response the client has to create and connect with a new request

- Best practice is to batch data for a short time so that you maximise efficiency in the connection window (which requires a bit of a dirty server side logic fork)

Comet
=====

- Comet is more formally known as "The Bayeux protocol"
- Combination of long-polling and JSONP polling on the server - code has already been written for you
- Added handshake for some client/server verification
- Slightly complex, requires a custom Java server (and thus lots of XML)

Dynamic script elements
=======================

- Fully cross domain
- Widely supported
- Lacks timeout features, as browsers never report that a script element didn't load
- Quasi-evented by way of JSONP callback firing when it returns
- To work around unknown timeouts:

  - Generate a sequence number, send with request
  - Always return after 60 seconds whether you have data or not
  - If returned sequence number of request is different from current on client, reset state and begin again (assuming you're only sending diffs)

Forever iframe
==============

- Transferred via dynamic ``iframe``
- Uses ``connection: keep-alive`` and ``Transfer-encoding: chunked`` to serve chunks of content into the ``iframe``
- ``iframe`` inserts dynamic ``script`` elements that invoke a function in the parent window (like JSONP)
- Constantly loading in IE, which is a bad user experience, unless you use an (surprise!) ActiveXControl called ``htmlfile``;
- Google Talk team discovered this, `according to Dojo's Alex Russell`__

WebSockets
==========

- HTTP 1.1 headers
- Handshake for authentication (as it opens a socket)

Non-blocking libraries
======================

- Take incoming request, route complexity to another function, move onto next request
- Requires different programming style, similar to custom events in Javascript - anything can fire or return at any time
- Good overview of the issues faced: http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html
- I'm no expert in this kind of programming, so I can't explain the issues in depth. Hence I make no judgement as to the quality of the following libraries:



Servers/libraries
=================

- Cometd implements the Bayeux protocol, and works with Jetty (Java);
- Tornado is the non-blocking Python web server used by Friendfeed. It impements non-blocking IO using callbacks. It has a socket.io implementation called Tornadio
- Eventlet is Linden Labs's (of Second Life fame) non-blocking evented Python framework. It uses a coroutine style. It has a WebSockets module for serving WebSockets;
- Twisted is a very complex networking and event library written in Python. I don't really understand it;
